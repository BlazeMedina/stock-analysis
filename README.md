The analysis for stocks performance in 2018 shows that all but two stocks had negative returns.  Stocks ENPH and RUN were the only stocks with positive returns for 2018.  Stocks DQ and JKS performed the worst with negative returns of -60% or less for 2018.


## Summary
Refactoring code entails restructuring original code so that it is more reliable, faster, and less complex.  The refactored VBA script allowed the analysis to run faster and much easier to determine stock performance with conditional formatting.
